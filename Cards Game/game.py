The function first checks if the game is about to finish, and also if we have a state of 2x2 board,
so in that case the second player wil always win (notice that 2x2 is not necessarily four adjacent cards but any two 
different pairs of cards or four completely separate cards), the function returns a positive or negative (1 or -1) value
according to the next player. The function also returns a positive/negative value if there is only one card left.
We can see that the heuristic is admissible since it returns a positive value only when the computer is guaranteed 
victory and vice versa.
